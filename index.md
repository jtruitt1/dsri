# **Digital Scholarship Research Institute**

<a href="https://forms.gle/SKUMEmmRF1gwdRKw9" target="_blank"><button class="button-blue">Application Form</button></a>

**Apply by March, 16th**

The Digital Scholarship Research Institute (DSRI) is a two-day intensive institute for Tri-Co faculty to explore interdisciplinary digital scholarship research and teaching methods through hands-on workshops and guided practices. We welcome both faculty new to digital scholarship and those interested in taking their skills to the next level. You can expect to gain experience with fundamental digital scholarship tools and methods including navigating your computer via the command line, cleaning messy data, practicing version control, and sharing your work publicly, while also learning about local digital scholarship communities and support.

### [Find out more about last year's insitute here.](2019)

The Digital Scholarship Research Institute will be held at the renovated Lutnick Library at Haverford College from **May 4-5, 2020**. Breakfast, lunch, and snacks will be catered on both days, and a beer and wine reception with hors d'oeuvres will be provided on the second day.

Because an essential aspect of the DSRI is building community among Tri-Co faculty members interested in digital scholarship, participants are expected to commit to attending the full two-day experience at Haverford College from May 4-5, 2020 and to attend all of the workshops, seminars, and events during this time.  (See childcare options provided or recommended by [Bryn Mawr](https://www.brynmawr.edu/humanresources/daycare-assistance), [Haverford](https://www.haverford.edu/sites/default/files/Office/Provost/HC-Daycare-Recommendations.pdf), and [Swarthmore](https://www.swarthmore.edu/human-resources/child-and-eldercare-resources).)

*The DSRI is sponsored by Bryn Mawr Collegeâ€™s LITS, Haverford College Libraries, and Swarthmore Libraries. The Tri-Co DSRI was developed as part of the NEH-sponsored [Digital Humanities Research Institute](http://dhinstitutes.org/) hosted at the CUNY Grad Center in June 2018.*

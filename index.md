# **Digital Scholarship Research Institute 2021**

The Trico Libraries Digital Scholarship Group is pleased to announce the 2022 Trico Digital Scholarship Research Institute (DSRI), a one-day program of workshops, discussions, and project showcases that explore interdisciplinary digital scholarship research and teaching methods. We welcome Trico faculty and staff new to digital scholarship as well as those interested in taking their existing skills to the next level. 

During this yearâ€™s institute, participants will gain experience with fundamental digital scholarship tools and methods (schedule TBD). We will also discuss project support and grant opportunities in the Trico and beyond, crafting potential projects and digital assignments, and finding our way through the maze of possible tools, services, and platforms.

The Digital Scholarship Research Institute will be hosted at Haverford College on Monday, May 2.

We look forward to seeing you this summer! ðŸ˜Ž
